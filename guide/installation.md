# Installation

Install the `tiptap` package with your favorite package manager:
```
npm add tiptap
```
or
```
yarn add tiptap
```

Although optional, you might want to install [`tiptap-extensions`](./extensions.html#installation) package
so that you can use many of the ready-made components maintained by the tiptap team.

> Older versions of NPM requires you to use `npm install` instead.

## Basic Usage

You can create a working editor with very little code. The basic building blocks you need are the 
[`Editor` class][@editor-class] and the [`EditorContent` component][@editor-content-component]

```vue
<template>
  <editor-content :editor="editor" />
</template>

<script>
// Import the basic building blocks
import { Editor, EditorContent } from 'tiptap'

export default {
  components: {
    EditorContent,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      // Create an `Editor` instance with some default content. The editor is 
      // then passed to the `EditorContent` component as a `prop`
      editor: new Editor({
        content: '<p>This is just a boring paragraph</p>',
      }),
    }
  },
  beforeDestroy() {
    // Always destroy your editor instance when it's no longer needed
    this.editor.destroy()
  },
}
</script>
```
